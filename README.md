<h1>Project Title</h1>
User Shopping Products

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This Application shows a list of predefined food products with their use by Dates in Years. Users can also manually add a Food product of their choice and use by dates, and thereafter, they can add it to a Shopping cart where they can view the added items and remove existing items

I used create-react-app to execute the project.
